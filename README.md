# Krystynas Prework Study Guide

## Description

The motivation to create this prework study guide was to both provide a cheat sheet of sorts for the bootcamp I will soon commence, as well as be a guide for other aspiring developers. 

This project has allowed me to pratice some rudimentary skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
